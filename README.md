# Launch a vanilla Lando app with one command

## Requirements

All you need is l...ando. See https://docs.lando.dev/basics/installation.html.

## Usage

Launch an app in a lando docker container quickly by provinding a short command, e.g.

```
# Drupal 7
scripts/drupal7.sh myapp

# Drupal 8
scripts/drupal8.sh myapp

# Drupal 9
scripts/drupal9.sh myapp

# Node
scripts/node.sh myapp
```

Replace `myapp` with something that makes sense in your case.
